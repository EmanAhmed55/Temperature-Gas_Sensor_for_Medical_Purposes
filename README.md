# Temperature-Gas_Sensor_for_Medical_Purposes
This Arduino project effectively monitors temperature and gas levels, providing immediate feedback through visual (LEDs) and auditory (buzzer) alerts. By using the LM35 and MQ-2 sensors, the system can ensure safety in environments where temperature and gas concentrations are critical.
